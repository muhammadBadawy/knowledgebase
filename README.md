# knowledgebase

This is the place where I keep the knowledge I learn about any topic I find interesting,

I forget a lot, so the best way to keep information is by making summaries about the material and keeping then in a well formated place to make sure I can revise them whenever I need to

The hierarchy of the knowledge base
